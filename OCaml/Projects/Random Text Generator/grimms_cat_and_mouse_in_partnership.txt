"\nA certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had said so much\nto her about the great love and friendship she felt for her, that at\nlength the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together.\n'But we must make a provision for winter, or else we shall suffer\nfrom hunger,' said the cat; 'and you, little mouse, cannot venture\neverywhere, or you will be caught in a trap some day.' The good advice\nwas followed, and a pot of fat was bought, but they did not know where\nto put it. At length, after much consideration, the cat said: 'I know no\nplace where it will be better stored up than in the church, for no one\ndares take anything away from there. We will set it beneath the altar,\nand not touch it until we are really in need of it.' So the pot was\nplaced in safety, but it was not long before the cat had a great\nyearning for it, and said to the mouse: 'I want to tell you something,\nlittle mouse; my cousin has brought a little son into the world, and has\nasked me to be godmother; he is white with brown spots, and I am to hold\nhim over the font at the christening. Let me go out today, and you look\nafter the house by yourself.' 'Yes, yes,' answered the mouse, 'by all\nmeans go, and if you get anything very good to eat, think of me. I\nshould like a drop of sweet red christening wine myself.' All this,\nhowever, was untrue; the cat had no cousin, and had not been asked to\nbe godmother. She went straight to the church, stole to the pot of fat,\nbegan to lick at it, and licked the top of the fat off. Then she took a\nwalk upon the roofs of the town, looked out for opportunities, and then\nstretched herself in the sun, and licked her lips whenever she thought\nof the pot of fat, and not until it was evening did she return home.\n'Well, here you are again,' said the mouse, 'no doubt you have had a\nmerry day.' 'All went off well,' answered the cat. 'What name did they\ngive the child?' 'Top off!' said the cat quite coolly. 'Top off!' cried\nthe mouse, 'that is a very odd and uncommon name, is it a usual one in\nyour family?' 'What does that matter,' said the cat, 'it is no worse\nthan Crumb-stealer, as your godchildren are called.'\n\nBefore long the cat was seized by another fit of yearning. She said to\nthe mouse: 'You must do me a favour, and once more manage the house for\na day alone. I am again asked to be godmother, and, as the child has a\nwhite ring round its neck, I cannot refuse.' The good mouse consented,\nbut the cat crept behind the town walls to the church, and devoured\nhalf the pot of fat. 'Nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to\noneself,' said she, and was quite satisfied with her day's work. When\nshe went home the mouse inquired: 'And what was the child christened?'\n'Half-done,' answered the cat. 'Half-done! What are you saying? I\nnever heard the name in my life, I'll wager anything it is not in the\ncalendar!'\n\nThe cat's mouth soon began to water for some more licking. 'All good\nthings go in threes,' said she, 'I am asked to stand godmother again.\nThe child is quite black, only it has white paws, but with that\nexception, it has not a single white hair on its whole body; this only\nhappens once every few years, you will let me go, won't you?' 'Top-off!\nHalf-done!' answered the mouse, 'they are such odd names, they make me\nvery thoughtful.' 'You sit at home,' said the cat, 'in your dark-grey\nfur coat and long tail, and are filled with fancies, that's because\nyou do not go out in the daytime.' During the cat's absence the mouse\ncleaned the house, and put it in order, but the greedy cat entirely\nemptied the pot of fat. 'When everything is eaten up one has some\npeace,' said she to herself, and well filled and fat she did not return\nhome till night. The mouse at once asked what name had been given to\nthe third child. 'It will not please you more than the others,' said the\ncat. 'He is called All-gone.' 'All-gone,' cried the mouse 'that is the\nmost suspicious name of all! I have never seen it in print. All-gone;\nwhat can that mean?' and she shook her head, curled herself up, and lay\ndown to sleep.\n\nFrom this time forth no one invited the cat to be godmother, but\nwhen the winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found\noutside, the mouse thought of their provision, and said: 'Come, cat,\nwe will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves--we\nshall enjoy that.' 'Yes,' answered the cat, 'you will enjoy it as much\nas you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the\nwindow.' They set out on their way, but when they arrived, the pot of\nfat certainly was still in its place, but it was empty. 'Alas!' said the\nmouse, 'now I see what has happened, now it comes to light! You are a true\nfriend! You have devoured all when you were standing godmother. First\ntop off, then half-done, then--' 'Will you hold your tongue,' cried the\ncat, 'one word more, and I will eat you too.' 'All-gone' was already on\nthe poor mouse's lips; scarcely had she spoken it before the cat sprang\non her, seized her, and swallowed her down. Verily, that is the way of\nthe world.\n"
