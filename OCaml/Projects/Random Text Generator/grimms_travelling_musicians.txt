"\nAn honest farmer had once an ass that had been a faithful servant to him\na great many years, but was now growing old and every day more and more\nunfit for work. His master therefore was tired of keeping him and\nbegan to think of putting an end to him; but the ass, who saw that some\nmischief was in the wind, took himself slyly off, and began his journey\ntowards the great city, 'For there,' thought he, 'I may turn musician.'\n\nAfter he had travelled a little way, he spied a dog lying by the\nroadside and panting as if he were tired. 'What makes you pant so, my\nfriend?' said the ass. 'Alas!' said the dog, 'my master was going to\nknock me on the head, because I am old and weak, and can no longer make\nmyself useful to him in hunting; so I ran away; but what can I do to\nearn my livelihood?' 'Hark ye!' said the ass, 'I am going to the great\ncity to turn musician: suppose you go with me, and try what you can\ndo in the same way?' The dog said he was willing, and they jogged on\ntogether.\n\nThey had not gone far before they saw a cat sitting in the middle of the\nroad and making a most rueful face. 'Pray, my good lady,' said the ass,\n'what's the matter with you? You look quite out of spirits!' 'Ah, me!'\nsaid the cat, 'how can one be in good spirits when one's life is in\ndanger? Because I am beginning to grow old, and had rather lie at my\nease by the fire than run about the house after the mice, my mistress\nlaid hold of me, and was going to drown me; and though I have been lucky\nenough to get away from her, I do not know what I am to live upon.'\n'Oh,' said the ass, 'by all means go with us to the great city; you are\na good night singer, and may make your fortune as a musician.' The cat\nwas pleased with the thought, and joined the party.\n\nSoon afterwards, as they were passing by a farmyard, they saw a cock\nperched upon a gate, and screaming out with all his might and main.\n'Bravo!' said the ass; 'upon my word, you make a famous noise; pray what\nis all this about?' 'Why,' said the cock, 'I was just now saying that\nwe should have fine weather for our washing-day, and yet my mistress and\nthe cook don't thank me for my pains, but threaten to cut off my\nhead tomorrow, and make broth of me for the guests that are coming\non Sunday!' 'Heaven forbid!' said the ass, 'come with us Master\nChanticleer; it will be better, at any rate, than staying here to have\nyour head cut off! Besides, who knows? If we care to sing in tune, we\nmay get up some kind of a concert; so come along with us.' 'With all my\nheart,' said the cock: so they all four went on jollily together.\n\nThey could not, however, reach the great city the first day; so when\nnight came on, they went into a wood to sleep. The ass and the dog laid\nthemselves down under a great tree, and the cat climbed up into the\nbranches; while the cock, thinking that the higher he sat the safer he\nshould be, flew up to the very top of the tree, and then, according to\nhis custom, before he went to sleep, looked out on all sides of him to\nsee that everything was well. In doing this, he saw afar off something\nbright and shining and calling to his companions said, 'There must be a\nhouse no great way off, for I see a light.' 'If that be the case,' said\nthe ass, 'we had better change our quarters, for our lodging is not the\nbest in the world!' 'Besides,' added the dog, 'I should not be the\nworse for a bone or two, or a bit of meat.' So they walked off together\ntowards the spot where Chanticleer had seen the light, and as they drew\nnear it became larger and brighter, till they at last came close to a\nhouse in which a gang of robbers lived.\n\nThe ass, being the tallest of the company, marched up to the window and\npeeped in. 'Well, Donkey,' said Chanticleer, 'what do you see?' 'What\ndo I see?' replied the ass. 'Why, I see a table spread with all kinds of\ngood things, and robbers sitting round it making merry.' 'That would\nbe a noble lodging for us,' said the cock. 'Yes,' said the ass, 'if we\ncould only get in'; so they consulted together how they should contrive\nto get the robbers out; and at last they hit upon a plan. The ass placed\nhimself upright on his hind legs, with his forefeet resting against the\nwindow; the dog got upon his back; the cat scrambled up to the dog's\nshoulders, and the cock flew up and sat upon the cat's head. When\nall was ready a signal was given, and they began their music. The ass\nbrayed, the dog barked, the cat mewed, and the cock screamed; and then\nthey all broke through the window at once, and came tumbling into\nthe room, amongst the broken glass, with a most hideous clatter! The\nrobbers, who had been not a little frightened by the opening concert,\nhad now no doubt that some frightful hobgoblin had broken in upon them,\nand scampered away as fast as they could.\n\nThe coast once clear, our travellers soon sat down and dispatched what\nthe robbers had left, with as much eagerness as if they had not expected\nto eat again for a month. As soon as they had satisfied themselves, they\nput out the lights, and each once more sought out a resting-place to\nhis own liking. The donkey laid himself down upon a heap of straw in\nthe yard, the dog stretched himself upon a mat behind the door, the\ncat rolled herself up on the hearth before the warm ashes, and the\ncock perched upon a beam on the top of the house; and, as they were all\nrather tired with their journey, they soon fell asleep.\n\nBut about midnight, when the robbers saw from afar that the lights were\nout and that all seemed quiet, they began to think that they had been in\ntoo great a hurry to run away; and one of them, who was bolder than\nthe rest, went to see what was going on. Finding everything still, he\nmarched into the kitchen, and groped about till he found a match in\norder to light a candle; and then, espying the glittering fiery eyes of\nthe cat, he mistook them for live coals, and held the match to them to\nlight it. But the cat, not understanding this joke, sprang at his face,\nand spat, and scratched at him. This frightened him dreadfully, and away\nhe ran to the back door; but there the dog jumped up and bit him in the\nleg; and as he was crossing over the yard the ass kicked him; and the\ncock, who had been awakened by the noise, crowed with all his might. At\nthis the robber ran back as fast as he could to his comrades, and told\nthe captain how a horrid witch had got into the house, and had spat at\nhim and scratched his face with her long bony fingers; how a man with a\nknife in his hand had hidden himself behind the door, and stabbed him\nin the leg; how a black monster stood in the yard and struck him with a\nclub, and how the devil had sat upon the top of the house and cried out,\n'Throw the rascal up here!' After this the robbers never dared to go\nback to the house; but the musicians were so pleased with their quarters\nthat they took up their abode there; and there they are, I dare say, at\nthis very day.\n"
