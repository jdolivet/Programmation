"\nNo one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth\ncentury that this world was being watched keenly and closely by\nintelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own; that as\nmen busied themselves about their various concerns they were\nscrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a\nmicroscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and\nmultiply in a drop of water.  With infinite complacency men went to\nand fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their\nassurance of their empire over matter.  It is possible that the\ninfusoria under the microscope do the same.  No one gave a thought to\nthe older worlds of space as sources of human danger, or thought of\nthem only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or\nimprobable.  It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of\nthose departed days.  At most terrestrial men fancied there might be\nother men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to\nwelcome a missionary enterprise.  Yet across the gulf of space, minds\nthat are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish,\nintellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with\nenvious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us.  And\nearly in the twentieth century came the great disillusionment.\n\nThe planet Mars, I scarcely need remind the reader, revolves about the\nsun at a mean distance of 140,000,000 miles, and the light and heat it\nreceives from the sun is barely half of that received by this world.\nIt must be, if the nebular hypothesis has any truth, older than our\nworld; and long before this earth ceased to be molten, life upon its\nsurface must have begun its course.  The fact that it is scarcely one\nseventh of the volume of the earth must have accelerated its cooling\nto the temperature at which life could begin.  It has air and water\nand all that is necessary for the support of animated existence.\n\nYet so vain is man, and so blinded by his vanity, that no writer,\nup to the very end of the nineteenth century, expressed any idea that\nintelligent life might have developed there far, or indeed at all,\nbeyond its earthly level.  Nor was it generally understood that since\nMars is older than our earth, with scarcely a quarter of the\nsuperficial area and remoter from the sun, it necessarily follows that\nit is not only more distant from time's beginning but nearer its end.\n\nThe secular cooling that must someday overtake our planet has\nalready gone far indeed with our neighbour.  Its physical condition is\nstill largely a mystery, but we know now that even in its equatorial\nregion the midday temperature barely approaches that of our coldest\nwinter.  Its air is much more attenuated than ours, its oceans have\nshrunk until they cover but a third of its surface, and as its slow\nseasons change huge snowcaps gather and melt about either pole and\nperiodically inundate its temperate zones.  That last stage of\nexhaustion, which to us is still incredibly remote, has become a\npresent-day problem for the inhabitants of Mars.  The immediate\npressure of necessity has brightened their intellects, enlarged their\npowers, and hardened their hearts.  And looking across space with\ninstruments, and intelligences such as we have scarcely dreamed of,\nthey see, at its nearest distance only 35,000,000 of miles sunward of\nthem, a morning star of hope, our own warmer planet, green with\nvegetation and grey with water, with a cloudy atmosphere eloquent of\nfertility, with glimpses through its drifting cloud wisps of broad\nstretches of populous country and narrow, navy-crowded seas.\n\nAnd we men, the creatures who inhabit this earth, must be to them\nat least as alien and lowly as are the monkeys and lemurs to us.  The\nintellectual side of man already admits that life is an incessant\nstruggle for existence, and it would seem that this too is the belief\nof the minds upon Mars.  Their world is far gone in its cooling and\nthis world is still crowded with life, but crowded only with what they\nregard as inferior animals.  To carry warfare sunward is, indeed,\ntheir only escape from the destruction that, generation after\ngeneration, creeps upon them.\n\nAnd before we judge of them too harshly we must remember what\nruthless and utter destruction our own species has wrought, not only\nupon animals, such as the vanished bison and the dodo, but upon its\ninferior races.  The Tasmanians, in spite of their human likeness,\nwere entirely swept out of existence in a war of extermination waged\nby European immigrants, in the space of fifty years.  Are we such\napostles of mercy as to complain if the Martians warred in the same\nspirit?\n\nThe Martians seem to have calculated their descent with amazing\nsubtlety--their mathematical learning is evidently far in excess of\nours--and to have carried out their preparations with a well-nigh\nperfect unanimity.  Had our instruments permitted it, we might have\nseen the gathering trouble far back in the nineteenth century.  Men\nlike Schiaparelli watched the red planet--it is odd, by-the-bye, that\nfor countless centuries Mars has been the star of war--but failed to\ninterpret the fluctuating appearances of the markings they mapped so\nwell.  All that time the Martians must have been getting ready.\n\nDuring the opposition of 1894 a great light was seen on the\nilluminated part of the disk, first at the Lick Observatory, then by\nPerrotin of Nice, and then by other observers.  English readers heard\nof it first in the issue of _Nature_ dated August 2.  I am inclined to\nthink that this blaze may have been the casting of the huge gun, in\nthe vast pit sunk into their planet, from which their shots were fired\nat us.  Peculiar markings, as yet unexplained, were seen near the site\nof that outbreak during the next two oppositions.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six years ago now.  As Mars approached\nopposition, Lavelle of Java set the wires of the astronomical exchange\npalpitating with the amazing intelligence of a huge outbreak of\nincandescent gas upon the planet.  It had occurred towards midnight of\nthe twelfth; and the spectroscope, to which he had at once resorted,\nindicated a mass of flaming gas, chiefly hydrogen, moving with an\nenormous velocity towards this earth.  This jet of fire had become\ninvisible about a quarter past twelve.  He compared it to a colossal\npuff of flame suddenly and violently squirted out of the planet, \"as\nflaming gases rushed out of a gun.\"\n\nA singularly appropriate phrase it proved.  Yet the next day there\nwas nothing of this in the papers except a little note in the _Daily\nTelegraph_, and the world went in ignorance of one of the gravest\ndangers that ever threatened the human race. I might not have heard of\nthe eruption at all had I not met Ogilvy, the well-known astronomer,\nat Ottershaw.  He was immensely excited at the news, and in the excess\nof his feelings invited me up to take a turn with him that night in a\nscrutiny of the red planet.\n\nIn spite of all that has happened since, I still remember that\nvigil very distinctly: the black and silent observatory, the shadowed\nlantern throwing a feeble glow upon the floor in the corner, the\nsteady ticking of the clockwork of the telescope, the little slit in\nthe roof--an oblong profundity with the stardust streaked across it.\nOgilvy moved about, invisible but audible.  Looking through the\ntelescope, one saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet\nswimming in the field.  It seemed such a little thing, so bright and\nsmall and still, faintly marked with transverse stripes, and slightly\nflattened from the perfect round.  But so little it was, so silvery\nwarm--a pin's-head of light! It was as if it quivered, but really this\nwas the telescope vibrating with the activity of the clockwork that\nkept the planet in view.\n\nAs I watched, the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller and to\nadvance and recede, but that was simply that my eye was tired.  Forty\nmillions of miles it was from us--more than forty millions of miles of\nvoid.  Few people realise the immensity of vacancy in which the dust\nof the material universe swims.\n\nNear it in the field, I remember, were three faint points of light,\nthree telescopic stars infinitely remote, and all around it was the\nunfathomable darkness of empty space.  You know how that blackness\nlooks on a frosty starlight night.  In a telescope it seems far\nprofounder.  And invisible to me because it was so remote and small,\nflying swiftly and steadily towards me across that incredible\ndistance, drawing nearer every minute by so many thousands of miles,\ncame the Thing they were sending us, the Thing that was to bring so\nmuch struggle and calamity and death to the earth.  I never dreamed of\nit then as I watched; no one on earth dreamed of that unerring\nmissile.\n\nThat night, too, there was another jetting out of gas from the\ndistant planet.  I saw it.  A reddish flash at the edge, the slightest\nprojection of the outline just as the chronometer struck midnight; and\nat that I told Ogilvy and he took my place.  The night was warm and I\nwas thirsty, and I went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way\nin the darkness, to the little table where the siphon stood, while\nOgilvy exclaimed at the streamer of gas that came out towards us.\n\nThat night another invisible missile started on its way to the\nearth from Mars, just a second or so under twenty-four hours after the\nfirst one.  I remember how I sat on the table there in the blackness,\nwith patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes.  I wished I\nhad a light to smoke by, little suspecting the meaning of the minute\ngleam I had seen and all that it would presently bring me.  Ogilvy\nwatched till one, and then gave it up; and we lit the lantern and\nwalked over to his house.  Down below in the darkness were Ottershaw\nand Chertsey and all their hundreds of people, sleeping in peace.\n\nHe was full of speculation that night about the condition of Mars,\nand scoffed at the vulgar idea of its having inhabitants who were\nsignalling us.  His idea was that meteorites might be falling in a\nheavy shower upon the planet, or that a huge volcanic explosion was in\nprogress.  He pointed out to me how unlikely it was that organic\nevolution had taken the same direction in the two adjacent planets.\n\n\"The chances against anything manlike on Mars are a million to\none,\" he said.\n\nHundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after\nabout midnight, and again the night after; and so for ten nights, a\nflame each night.  Why the shots ceased after the tenth no one on\nearth has attempted to explain.  It may be the gases of the firing\ncaused the Martians inconvenience.  Dense clouds of smoke or dust,\nvisible through a powerful telescope on earth as little grey,\nfluctuating patches, spread through the clearness of the planet's\natmosphere and obscured its more familiar features.\n\nEven the daily papers woke up to the disturbances at last, and\npopular notes appeared here, there, and everywhere concerning the\nvolcanoes upon Mars.  The seriocomic periodical _Punch_, I remember,\nmade a happy use of it in the political cartoon.  And, all\nunsuspected, those missiles the Martians had fired at us drew\nearthward, rushing now at a pace of many miles a second through the\nempty gulf of space, hour by hour and day by day, nearer and nearer.\nIt seems to me now almost incredibly wonderful that, with that swift\nfate hanging over us, men could go about their petty concerns as they\ndid.  I remember how jubilant Markham was at securing a new photograph\nof the planet for the illustrated paper he edited in those days.\nPeople in these latter times scarcely realise the abundance and\nenterprise of our nineteenth-century papers.  For my own part, I was\nmuch occupied in learning to ride the bicycle, and busy upon a series\nof papers discussing the probable developments of moral ideas as\ncivilisation progressed.\n\nOne night (the first missile then could scarcely have been\n10,000,000 miles away) I went for a walk with my wife.  It was\nstarlight and I explained the Signs of the Zodiac to her, and pointed\nout Mars, a bright dot of light creeping zenithward, towards which so\nmany telescopes were pointed.  It was a warm night.  Coming home, a\nparty of excursionists from Chertsey or Isleworth passed us singing\nand playing music.  There were lights in the upper windows of the\nhouses as the people went to bed.  From the railway station in the\ndistance came the sound of shunting trains, ringing and rumbling,\nsoftened almost into melody by the distance.  My wife pointed out to\nme the brightness of the red, green, and yellow signal lights hanging\nin a framework against the sky.  It seemed so safe and tranquil.\n"
